Distracted Driving Notes

dropping
cols:
fpogs (start time since init of pog)
fpogid (id of the gaze.. which is duplicate info since fpogd shows duration)
CS (cursor position id)
CX and CY (mouse position)
rows:
fpogv (is the fixation pog valid)
(The valid flag with value of 1 (TRUE) if the fixation POG data is valid, and 0
(FALSE) if it is not. FPOGV valid is TRUE ONLY when either one, or both, of the
eyes are detected AND a fixation is detected. FPOGV is FALSE all other times, for
example when the subject blinks, when there is no face in the field of view,
when the eyes move to the next fixation (i.e. a saccade). )
when fpogx = 0, the row is dropped

ANALYZE:
fpogv (is the fixation pog valid)

LPCX LPCY  (left eye pupil x and y  coords in cam img as fraction of cam img size)
RPCX RPCY  (right eye pupil x and y  coords in cam img as fraction of cam img size)

LPD/RPD (diameter of left/right eye pupil in pixels)

LPS/RPS (: The scale factor of the left/right eye pupil (unitless). Value equals 1 at calibration
depth, is less than 1 when user is closer to the eye tracker and greater than 1 when user
 is further away.)

LPV/RPV (whether the left/right eye pupil info is correct


Correct:
(bkdur is the preceding blink duration)
bkid should be changed to either 0 for none or 1 for blinking
